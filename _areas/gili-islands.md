  Well technically the Gili Islands are not a part of Bali, but they are popular and accessible neighbor islands. All three islands boast no motorized transport, meaning no cars and no motorbikes, which is definitely eco-friendly! Walk or bicycle rather than opting for transport by horse carriage.


  The Gilis include Gili T (technically Gili Trawangan), Gili Air, and Gili Meno (aka Gili M). Gili T is known for its party atmosphere and is relatively more developed than its siblings. Gili Air is a laidback, social backpacker island, while Gili Meno is known as the island for couples.
