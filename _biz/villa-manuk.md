Villa Manuk is an eco-lodge in a traditional Balinese village in northern Bali. They aim to run their business in harmony with the local village and the environment. It is a great place to stay for nature lovers. While they are not a "certified" eco-lodge, they are taking steps towards becoming one. According to Indonesia Organic, their eco-friendly, green, and organic practices include:

* minimized energy consumption
* producing their own organic cultivated traditional Bali rice (no pesticides, only usage of neem oil and organic fertilizers)
* no MSG
* spring water pool
* waste water system for kitchen waste water and for the complete Bambu Villa
* social projects (Manuksesa Children Project)
* correct disposal of waste
* all staff are local to the village
* tours support the local community
* around 50% of laundry is done with soap nuts
* use of neem oil and organic fertilizers for gardens
* limited use of cleaning products
* facilitate local garbage management (Bali cantik tanpa plastik)
